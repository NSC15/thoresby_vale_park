This website primary aim is to inform and attract potential customers to the new country park

<h2>User Experience (UX)</h2>

As a first time user of this website, i want to quickly find out the main purpose - being informed of the parks activities and the initial costing of entering and seeing some relative imagery.
I want to be able to navigate easily through the website with a simple functional Navigation to find extra information.
I want to be able to contact the park regards any further queries in the future.

<h2>Design</h2>

<h3>Colour Scheme</h3> 

Two main colours are Green and Yellow, with minor additions of white and black.

<h3>Font</h3>

Main fonts used are "Roboto Slab" and "Bebas Neue" (Sans Serif as the back-up) these fonts compliment each other and provided a clean text look to my site. As this site is informative, clarity is key.

<h3>Imagery</h3>

I have used relative images to content consistently. Main background image is to provide a forestry feel again to link with the theme / context of the website.
